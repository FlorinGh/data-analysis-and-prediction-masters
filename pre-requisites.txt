To optimize your chances for a successful application to our Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program, we’ve created a list of prerequisites and recommendations to help prepare you for the program curriculum. Prior to applying, you should consider taking our Intro to Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program (it's build for this reason) or have the following knowledge:

Intermediate Python (Classes, Data structures)
Intermediate C++ (Classes, Memory management, Linking)
Basic Linear Algebra (Matrices, Vectors, Matrix multiplication)
Basic Calculus (Derivatives, Integrals)
Basic Statistics (Mean, Standard deviation, Gaussian distribution)
Basic Physics (Forces)
Certain knowledge areas are particularly important to address, and we recommended the following resources for those wishing to refine their skills in these key arenas:

Python - The free Introduction To Python Programming Course on Udacity
Probability - Khan Academy's great probability lectures
Linear Algebra - Khan Academy's great linear algebra lectures
Calculus - Khan Academy's great multivariable calculus lectures
We also recommend the following suite of Udacity courses as excellent preparation for incoming students:

Artificial Intelligence for Robotics
Intro to Machine Learning
Intro to Data Science
Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program
Data Analyst Nanodegree program
Intro to Programming Nanodegree program
For those aspiring Self-Driving Car Engineers who currently have limited backgrounds in either programming or math, we recommend the following Nanodegree programs and courses:

Programming foundations with Python (course)
Intro to Programming (Nanodegree program)
Data Analyst (Nanodegree program)
And for those who have programming and math backgrounds, but would benefit from additional studies in machine learning and/or computer vision:

Intro to Machine Learning (course)
Intro to Data Science (course)
Intro to Computer Vision (course)
Artificial Intelligence for Robotics (course)
Machine Learning Engineer (Nanodegree program)
